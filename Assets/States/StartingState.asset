  storyText: "That guard walking there has no idea I am here. He has no clue that
    his life could end in an instant. It looks like he is walking down the hallway
    towards a reinforced door. I\n think that I can see a large opening in the oposite
    direction.\n\nI could probably take out that guard. Or I could let him pass and
    go to the large opening.\n \nWhat should I do?\n1. Grab the Guard \n2. Let the
    Guard pass and sneak to large opening."
